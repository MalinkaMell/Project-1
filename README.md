### Project description: 
A scheduling and planning tool for following your favorite band or tour. The application will allow the user to specify a performer and will list upcoming events, allow purchase of tickets, travel, local weather.  If time permits, maybe incorporate a calendaring tool.

---


### Sketch of design:

Main page will allow a user to select the artist/band etc. Alternatively, allow user to select a city and show all upcoming events for that location.  

Selecting an artist will navigate the user to a calendar page showing the next x upcoming events (possibly specified by the user). Also possibly specify the distance from current location within which to search or any distance. User can select one or more of the returned events to plan attendance.

Once events are selected, the application will allow the user to purchase tickets for the event (ticketfly and bandsintown apis may be used for this).  If the event(s) will require travel, navigate the user to another portal to book travel arrangements for flights(skyscanner) and hotels (booking api). Time permitting possibly add weather and map details.
